                Got my audio interface working and added the test for that to demos.

                Recorded two new demo thingies (Hypermarket_Industry_Records v2 and untitled_dc66) and added them to the website, plus added Sludge demos v1-v5. Removed the download links from the demos page because you can just right click them anyway. Bought the Hypermarket-Industry-Records.com domain and made it redirect to github.io, wanna make it the actual domain sometime.

            <p>Started making the website today. I think it's actually finished at this point in time. Maybe I'll make an easier way to add demos later instead of adding them manually but we'll see (probably not). Added the home page, blog page, and the demos page, along with three demos I recorded yesterday. I wanna add more, older demos later even if they suck (but what's new?) and maybe some of the ones where I just beatbox the tunes I have in my head. But not today. Also wanna get a domain for this, perhaps tomorrow. Also gonna publish it.</p>
