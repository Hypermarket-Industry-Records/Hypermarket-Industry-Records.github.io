                Nevermind. I am so awesome at using a metronome. Uploaded "mucky fingers oasis cover and sludge - metronome test 2" and aside from a few hiccups I think it's pretty well on time.

                Been testing an amp plugin in fl studio and added the tests from that to the demo page - "amptest" and "mucky fingers oasis cover - metronome test". As you can tell from the latter, I also tried using a metronome - something I have not done before - and retrospectively unsurprisingly did not play with it well. I've been drumming for a while and can use a metronome with that pretty well so I was just hoping that would carry over to guitar but I suppose not. Will have to do more practice. I've also recorded more demos on my phone but I can't be arsed to add them here yet so I won't. I also need to find out whether or not I prefer my guitar sound using my amp and recording it with my phone or with my audio interface with the amp plugin. I also think I was recording with a lower bitrate in the mucky fingers cover than amptest and therefore it sounds worse, but I don't know if it's that or the amp plugin settings I used. We will have to see. I think it's the quality though.

                Got my audio interface working and added the test for that to demos.

                Recorded two new demo thingies (Hypermarket_Industry_Records v2 and untitled_dc66) and added them to the website, plus added Sludge demos v1-v5. Removed the download links from the demos page because you can just right click them anyway. Bought the Hypermarket-Industry-Records.com domain and made it redirect to github.io, wanna make it the actual domain sometime.

            <p>Started making the website today. I think it's actually finished at this point in time. Maybe I'll make an easier way to add demos later instead of adding them manually but we'll see (probably not). Added the home page, blog page, and the demos page, along with three demos I recorded yesterday. I wanna add more, older demos later even if they suck (but what's new?) and maybe some of the ones where I just beatbox the tunes I have in my head. But not today. Also wanna get a domain for this, perhaps tomorrow. Also gonna publish it.</p>
