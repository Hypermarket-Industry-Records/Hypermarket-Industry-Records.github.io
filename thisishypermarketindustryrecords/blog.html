            <b>(25/6/2024)</b>
            <p>Started making the website today. I think it's actually finished at this point in time. Maybe I'll make an easier way to add demos later instead of adding them manually but we'll see (probably not). Added the home page, blog page, and the demos page, along with three demos I recorded yesterday. I wanna add more, older demos later even if they suck (but what's new?) and maybe some of the ones where I just beatbox the tunes I have in my head. But not today. Also wanna get a domain for this, perhaps tomorrow.</p>
